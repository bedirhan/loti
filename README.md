# loti
Lord of the Inputs - LOTI ;) is an online & interactive learning resource for developers whose input-aware applications are targeted both by attackers and everyday users. None of the input control strategies are really silver-bullets for preventing cyber attacks. They are critical but also hard to implement correctly. So scope-aware, in other words, input type-aware input controls should be pursued... Long story short, write your regular expression and make everything green!
